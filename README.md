The Red Cathedral bits boxes
----------------------------

This repo contains 3d printable trays to help manage all the bits required
to play The Red Cathedral. None of these parts require support.

The OpenSCAD code could do with a re-write, the design evolved quite a bit
over the course of the project, but it's servicable. Download and print the
STLs if you don't want to fiddle with the SCAD.
